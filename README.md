# Completing and Submitting Assignments with CodeGrade

## Learning Goals

- Understand the steps needed to complete an assignment
- Submit assignments in Canvas through CodeGrade

## Introduction

**Important**: depending on when you enrolled in the Software Engineering Prep
course, you may already have learned how to complete assignments and submit them
using CodeGrade. If so, you are free to skip this lesson.

**However**, if you used the `learn-co` gem and the `learn test` command to
complete labs in Prep, **it is very important to work through this lesson
carefully and make sure you understand the process**. Some of the information in
this lesson will be review, but there are several important differences between
the process you learned previously and the one you will learn in this lesson; we
will point out these differences as we go.

Be sure to take the time you need now to get comfortable with the process of
completing and submitting assignments. You will use it for every lab you do
throughout the Software Engineering curriculum!

Below is the general process you will learn:

- From the assignment's GitHub repo, create a fork of the assignment into your
  GitHub account.
- Clone your personal copy to your computer.
- Run the tests using the `npm test` command, and complete the work required to
  get them to pass.
- Push your completed code back up to your GitHub repo.
- Submit your completed work in Canvas through the CodeGrade window.

We will go through each of these steps in detail below.

## Completing and Submitting Assignments

### Accessing GitHub and Forking

As you learned in Prep, all the lessons in the curriculum have a corresponding
repository (repo) in GitHub. On this page in Canvas, you should see two icons in
the **upper right** corner. The first is the GitHub logo, also known as OctoCat.

![Screenshot pointing to OctoCat icon](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/completing-assignments-with-codegrade/octocat.png)

Clicking the OctoCat icon will open the lesson's GitHub repo. The second icon is
a flag, which you can use to submit an _issue_ for the lesson (e.g., if you find
a typo or other error).

To fork an assignment, click the **Octocat** button to open its GitHub repo. In
the top right corner of the repo, you should see a button that says **Fork**.

![Screenshot point out 'Fork' button](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/completing-assignments-with-codegrade/fork-button.png)

Click on that, and you should get a screen that looks something like this:

![Screenshot of the 'Create a new fork' form](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/completing-assignments-with-codegrade/create-fork.png)

Verify that your GitHub username is showing in the **Owner** dropdown, then
click the **Create fork** button.

:bulb: **NEW:** There is no more Fork button in Canvas; instead, you'll navigate
to the lab's GitHub repo and fork from there.

Forking is a process which creates an exact copy of a collection of code and
files. Once you've created a fork on your own GitHub account, you will be able
to edit the files in the repository and write your own code solution without
interfering with the original copy.

Once your fork is ready, the next step is to download (**clone**) your new
repository to your local machine.

### Cloning to Your Local Machine

**Note:** You should already be familiar with the steps in this section; we are
including them here for completeness.

To download the repository for this lesson, first make sure you're in your
personal fork on GitHub. You can check this by looking in the top left of the
GitHub repository, where it shows the name.

![Screenshot showing example of forked repo](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/completing-assignments-with-codegrade/forked-repo.png)

If you see your GitHub username before the name of the repo,
phase-1-completing-assignments-with-codegrade, as well as a subtitle saying
"forked from ...", then you are in the right place.

Once you're in your forked version of the repo, click the **Code** button. A
pop-up will appear which shows several options for cloning; switch to the
**SSH** option if it isn't already selected. Next, click the copy button.

![clone-repo](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/completing-assignments/clone-repo.gif)

Now, open your terminal and navigate to where you'd like to download the
assignment (e.g. `cd ~/Development/code/phase-1`). Type `git clone` and a space,
then paste in the copied SSH link from GitHub. It should look something like
this:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:your-github-username/phase-1-completing-assignments-with-codegrade.git
```

Press enter, and you should see a flurry of terminal activity. Once the terminal
gives you control to type again, a new folder with the GitHub name of the
assignment will have been created. Change directory into this folder to access
the assignment files.

```console
$ cd phase-1-completing-assignments-with-codegrade
```

Finally, type `code .` to open the lab's files in Visual Studio Code.

### Working on an Assignment

This assignment has two tests. The first checks to see if you've correctly
cloned this assignment to your local machine. If you've followed the steps
above, you've completed everything you need to do to pass the first test. Now,
we need to run the tests and find out what the second one is.

First, run `npm install` in the terminal to install the tools necessary to run
the tests. You should again see a flurry of text as dependencies are installed.

> **Note**: You may get a warnings or a message from the terminal saying there
> are vulnerabilities. **These are okay to ignore** - they are normal! You
> **should not** run the audit command the terminal provides you with as it will
> change the versions of the node dependencies for a lesson, which we do _not_
> want to do.

:bulb: **NEW:** Run `npm install` to install the tests' dependencies each time
you clone down a lab.

Once the installations are complete, run `npm test` in the terminal. You should
see the results of your tests. By cloning this assignment down, you've already
passed one test!

```console
This assignment
  ✓ has been correctly cloned to your local environment
  1) has a file named myfile.md

1) This assignment
      has a file named myfile.md:
    AssertionError: No file named 'myfile.md' found. Create one in the root of the assignment's directory: value: expected './myfile.md' to exist

1 passing (5ms)
1 failing
```

:bulb: **NEW:** Run `npm test` instead of `learn test` to run the test suite.

Although you passed one test, there is still one test not passing. The terminal
gave us a detailed "AssertionError" saying why we did not pass the test:

```console
1) This assignment
      has a file named myfile.md:
    AssertionError: No file named 'myfile.md' found. Create one in the root of the assignment's directory: value: expected './myfile.md' to exist
```

We can use this error to figure out what we need to do to pass it. In this case,
we just need to create a file called `myfile.md` inside the assignment
directory. Go head and create the file, from either the terminal or your code
editor.

When you run `npm test` in the terminal again, both tests should now be passing!

```console
  This assignment
    ✓ has been correctly cloned to your local environment
    ✓ has a file named myfile.md


  2 passing (4ms)
```

This is the general workflow you will follow when working on labs:

1. **Fork** the assignment repo to your GitHub account by clicking the Octocat
   button on the lab's Canvas page, then the "Fork" button on the lab's repo
   page.
2. **Clone** the lesson down to your machine.
3. Install the tools needed for the tests by running `npm install` in the
   terminal.
4. Run `npm test` to see what you need to do to get the tests passing.
5. Work on the assignment with those tests in mind.
6. As you work, run `npm test` in the terminal as many times as you'd like to
   test your code.
7. Once all your tests are passing, it's time to submit your assignment — or is
   it?

### Pushing your Changes to GitHub

If you go to your **forked** version of the assignment on GitHub, you'll see
that the `myfile.md` file you created is not there. This is because you only
made the change on your _local clone_. Changes that you make on a locally cloned
repository are not automatically synced to the repo up on GitHub. You have to
manually sync the changes. This is a good thing — it gives you more control over
what changes get "pushed" up to the GitHub repo and when.

The process requires three terminal commands:

1. `git add`
2. `git commit`
3. `git push`

> Recall that you learned about these commands near the end of the SE Prep
> course, in the [Git Basics][basics] and [Pushing Code with
> Git][pushing-with-git] lessons. You will use these commands for every lab you
> complete in this curriculum. You will also use them all the time when you're
> working as a software engineer. The process of committing and pushing to
> GitHub will become second nature soon enough, but if you need a refresher,
> it's a good idea to go back and review the two lessons mentioned above before
> you continue.

[basics]:
  https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-0-git-version-control-basics
[pushing-with-git]:
  https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-0-git-pushing-code

:bulb: **NEW:** You will use git commands to commit and push your code up to
GitHub.

These commands should be run in the terminal within the directory with changes
to push. For example with this assignment, you should be running the commands
within the `phase-1-completing-assignments-with-codegrade` directory.

#### Track changes with `git add`

This command lets us tell git what changes and files we want to sync within a
repo. You can specify certain files to track, or you can track all files at once
that have changes to sync.

To track specific files, you just need to add the file names as arguments. For
example:

```bash
git add file1.md file2.md
```

To track all files at once, you can use a period as an argument instead `.`:

```bash
git add .
```

Let's go ahead and track our change by using the `git add .` shortcut.

#### Save changes with `git commit`

Once you've tracked all the changes you want to save with `git add`, the next
step is to save all those changes at once. This is done with `git commit`. To
make a commit, the command is:

```bash
git commit -m "short message briefly explaining the changes saved in this commit"
```

Any time you commit something, you should include a message with it to explain
what changes are actually in the commit. These messages should be one line and
short. The `-m` flag says we want to add one and should be followed by the
message in quotes.

Let's commit our tracked change. In the terminal, run:

```bash
git commit -m "created myfile.md"
```

#### Push changes with `git push`

We've now tracked and saved our changes — but they're _still_ not up on the
GitHub repo. We need to tell Git to back up our changes to GitHub using the
`push` command:

```bash
git push
```

Recall from the [Pushing Code with Git][pushing-with-git] lesson that, because
you cloned this lab down from your personal fork on GitHub, git will
automatically push your changes back up to that same repo. (If you need a
refresher on pushing, go back and review that lesson.)

Now, finally, when you load your forked version of the assignment on GitHub, you
should see the `myfile.md` file! With all your work now available on GitHub, you
can submit the assignment.

**Note:** It is a good habit to get into to go to your repo on GitHub after you
push to verify that it completed successfully.

### Submitting an Assignment on CodeGrade

The final step is to submit your work to Canvas by connecting your repo to
CodeGrade. Before continuing with the steps below, **make sure that you're
logged in to your GitHub account.**

:bulb: **NEW:** To get credit for the lab in Canvas, you will submit your work
using CodeGrade.

To submit your work for grading, head back to the assignment on Canvas and
scroll down to the bottom of the page. There, you should see a button that says
"Load Submitting Assignments with CodeGrade in a new window".

![Load Complete Your First Software Engineering Assignment in a new window button](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/completing-assignments-with-codegrade/open-codegrade-btn.png)

Click on that button, and a new window of the CodeGrade interface should open
up. As you haven't submitted an assignment for this lab yet, click on the
"Create submission" button. On the next page that opens, click on the "GitHub"
button. A GitHub screen will open asking you to authorize CodeGrade. (Note: you
should only have to do this step the first time you create a submission.) Once
CodeGrade is authorized, as long as you're logged in to GitHub, CodeGrade should
be connected to your account.

![Gif showing the CodeGrade interface, creating a submission, and connecting to GitHub](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/completing-assignments-with-codegrade/connect-github-account.gif)

Once your GitHub account is connected, you should see a list of your repos in
the CodeGrade window. Find the repo that matches the assignment you're
submitting, in this case `phase-1-completing-assignments-with-codegrade`, and
click the blue "Connect" button.

When CodeGrade finishes connecting the repo, it should show you a success
message with a link to view your submission. Click on that link.

![Gif showing how to connect a GitHub repo on CodeGrade](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/completing-assignments-with-codegrade/connect-repo.gif)

On this new page, there are three different tabs: Code, Feedback Overview, and
AutoTest.

The _Code_ tab is as it sounds, all the code you submitted. The _Feedback
Overview_ is where you can see feedback on your work from instructors if they've
provided any.

The _AutoTest_ tab is what we'll focus on in this lesson. This tab is what runs
the test that automatically grades your work. It will take some time, and you
can see the progress in the small box on the right side of the Setup section.
When it's done, it will say "Done" and your score will update in the Automatic
Tests section.

![Gif showing the AutoTest running and completing](https://imgur.com/G5pzKwr.gif)

If you don't pass, don't fret, you can still fix it! You can click on the
test(s) within the Automatic Tests section to see which ones failed. Then, you
can fix those errors within your local version of the repo, and go through the
process of using `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to push your changes.
CodeGrade will then automatically re-run the test when it detects changes have
been made to the GitHub repo.

To see the results of the updated submission, navigate back to CodeGrade through
the button on Canvas. Instead of on "Create submission", click on the "Latest
submission" button to get taken back to the AutoTest page.

![Gif showing how to navigate back to AutoTest via the Latest submission button](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/completing-assignments-with-codegrade/latest-submission.gif)

Once your tests are all passing in CodeGrade, you are good to go. You can close
the CodeGrade window and move on to the next lesson.

Whew, that was a lot. While it will take some time in the beginning, the more
assignments you complete and submit, the easier the process should become. If
you ever forget a step, that's OK. Come back to this lesson as many times as you
need until it becomes second nature.

**Important Note Regarding Due Dates**: In order to set up CodeGrade on a Canvas
assignment it is necessary to set a due date. To ensure that all students —
regardless of which program they are in — will be able to submit their
assignments before the due date, default due dates are set to two years from
when the Canvas course is created, well after students must complete the course.

As a result, these default dates **should not** be used as a guide to determine
pacing through the program. Students in the Flex program should instead use the
Flex milestones to stay on pace, and students in the Live program should follow
the schedule laid out by their instructor.

## Troubleshooting

Errors and mistakes can happen, and this section will cover some common ones. If
your problem is not listed here, please check with an instructor or technical
coach for guidance.

### I got an error when I tried to clone a lab down to my Mac

If you are a Mac user and you see the following message:

```console
xcrun: error: invalid active developer path
```

You need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Run the following command to
install them:

```console
$ xcode-select --install
```

And follow the prompts. Then try running the `git clone` command again. See
[this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52522566) for more
details. Note that you may need to re-install `xcode-select` any time you update
your Mac OS version.

### I wasn't able to connect CodeGrade to my GitHub account

First, check to make sure you're logged in to your GitHub account. Then start
again from the assignment's Canvas page and repeat the steps in the "Submitting
an Assignment on CodeGrade" section above.

If it still does not work, try again, but instead of clicking the "GitHub"
button, click the "Or manually connect your Git repository" link underneath.
CodeGrade will walk you through the manual setup; be sure to read and follow
their instructions carefully.

### The tests are failing in CodeGrade

1. Make sure that you've connected the correct repo to CodeGrade. You can do
   that by clicking on the "Code" tab in CodeGrade and verifying that the title
   of the lab in the README.md file matches the title in Canvas. If you've
   connected the wrong repo, follow the instructions in the next section.

2. Re-run the tests in your local environment to verify that they are passing.

3. Make sure that your completed code was pushed up to GitHub. To do that,
   navigate to your repo on GitHub and check that the latest commit is showing.
   If the code was not pushed to GitHub, follow the instructions in the "Pushing
   your Changes to GitHub" section above. Once your code is pushed up, the tests
   will automatically rerun in CodeGrade and the results will be updated in the
   AutoTest tab. To see this, navigate back to CodeGrade by clicking the button
   on the assignment page in Canvas, then click on the "Latest submission"
   button. You may also want to verify that the assignment is showing as
   completed in Canvas.

### I accidentally connected the wrong repository! How do I remove it and connect the correct one?

To reconnect your CodeGrade assignment to a different repo, you will simply go
through the submission process again and select the correct repo. When you do
that, you will see a message warning you that you have already connected to the
repo and asking if you want to disconnect the current repo and select a new one:

![disconnect repo button](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-0/completing-assignments-codegrade/disconnect-repo.png)

Click the "Disconnect and select new repository" button. This will return you to
the list of repos where you can select the new repo to connect.

> **Note**: When you first go back through the submission process, the incorrect
> repo will still be under the "Latest Submissions". That is OK - it will be
> overridden once you submit a new repo.

The full process is:

1. Return to the lab's Canvas page and, if necessary, refresh the page to reload
   the CodeGrade button.
2. Click the button and, on the CodeGrade page that opens, click "Create
   Submission".
3. Select the new repo to connect.
4. In the page that opens, click the "Disconnect and select new repository"
   button.
5. Select the correct repo once again.

### I refreshed the CodeGrade page and it's asking me to log back in. What are my account details to log in?

If you don't remember creating a username and password for CodeGrade, that's
because you did not! To access CodeGrade, you must always do so from Canvas.

To get back to the submission page for a specific assignment, return to the
assignment on Canvas and click on the "Load" button at the bottom of the page
again. If the button is not there due to being clicked once before, refresh the
Canvas page and it should reappear.

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you've now completed this assignment and submitted it to
CodeGrade! You now know how to work on and submit assignments going forward:

- Click the **OctoCat** button on the Canvas assignment, then the **Fork**
  button on the repo page.
- Once the assignment is forked, clone it down to your local machine.
- Run `npm install` to download the tools required to run the tests for the
  assignment.
- Run `npm test` to see what tests you have to pass. Run the command as many
  times as you like to check your work as you go.
- Complete any required work, then run the `git add`, `git commit`, and
  `git push` commands in the terminal to push your work up to GitHub. Before
  continuing to the next step, be sure to load your repo on GitHub and verify
  that the latest commit is shown.
- Submit your assignment through CodeGrade by selecting your GitHub account,
  then connecting the appropriate repo.
